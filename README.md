# vue-template-typing
Just an idea for now - to make a webstorm extenstion that would show static typing errors in vue templates

Possibly could just use: https://github.com/Yuyz0112/vue-type-check

Supposedly will achieve this:
https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader/issues/1561

And this:
https://github.com/vuejs/vetur/issues/209

Since issues were stale for 3 years now, I guess there is no point in waiting.

This is how coding vue templates in a typescript project works now:

And this is what I'd like to achieve:

Would be also cool to add some annotation for mandatory parameters in a component...
